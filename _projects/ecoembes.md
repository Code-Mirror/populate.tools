description: "Ecoembes had a challenge to make great amounts of data accessible and usable by both employees and external collaborators. Current attempts with traditional intranet software make data browsing a poor experience. We helped them to define a data strategy: by making data publishing agile, and data usage a good experience. We customized, implemented and integrated the open source data portal CKAN with their systems."
