Once a potential client asked how our relation would work. We send this to them. It's nothing revolutionary and we are sure many other organizations work similarly, but since this can be applied to any project, we think it makes sense to share this on the open.

Some notes about Populate’s working process and ideas about publishing, digital product design and public engagement.

## Process

### Relationship
Although we may refer to the client as the “client”, we like to create a relationship that is more similar to a team of a peers working together than a client-provider scheme. We don’t just listen to requests and then go build them. Collaboration is key as the “client” is the one who knows best what needs to be built; we are here to help build this vision, question, amplify and improve ideas by providing our product design and technical experience. But getting to extract all the knowledge the client has is key to success, and that only is possible when collaboration happens.

### A great team
We value a lot being able to form a great team with our clients. For us “a great team” means fluid, fast and frictionless communication; a collaboration context in which client ideas and our own grow and improve; and when the result is satisfying for both parts. We have strong opinions on how things should work, and we give great importance to believing in what we are doing.

### Work environment
We value a lot our work environment. We spend most of our waking time working, so for us it’s important that we are happy while at it and that we create meaningful things in which we believe, be them small or large. We love to work, and work hard, but a good environment is essential for this. We turn down projects if we don’t see clearly that we are going to get along great with our clients. It’s also a selfish issue: if we are happy we’ll be more productive and the quality of our work will be greater.

### Try
In this sense, we prefer to start with a small and quick project that enables us and the client to get to know each other and see if we are a good fit.


## Practical issues

### Short iterations
When building a product we like to work in short iterations, and advance as much as possible the moment when the client interact with the actual product, even if it’s not finished.

### Practical tools
We use online project management tools like Basecamp to keep track of things: planification, milestones/deadlines, progress… we use it to share with the client partial deliverables, to discuss about them, raise issues, questions, etc. we try to minimize the use of email. We use other tools like Invision if a big visual deliverable is due, as it improves the experience. We also use Slack (real time chat) for small things.

### Periodic check-ins
We like to plan weekly or bi-weekly status meetings (over phone, Skype, etc), and are happy to meet whenever is needed. At the same time, we are huge fans of the order that a tool like Basecamp allows as everything entered there is visible, accessible, “referenceable”

### Project management
With the written proposal and budget we also present a broad timeline of milestones/phases (ie. concept, ux design, visual design, front-end, back-end, tests, etc) that takes into account client needs and objectives. When the project starts, we translate that to specific deadlines both for materials the client should provide and deliverables from our part. We name a person who is the main point of contact, and we expect the same from the client.

In this following section we went into the specifics of the potential project with the client. Again, since we talk about general media issues and expresses or views, we thought about sharing it redacting the clients name.

## Project definition and scope

Views and values around digital journalism, distributed content models, fundraising, content monetisation

### Content vs. Ideas vs. Tools
We may question ourselves which is the most effective way to spread ideas in the age of quick, small, and short impacts and RTs, Facebook likes, and pilldorized content… Social networks are the new gateway for massive traffic and content distribution, and in this environment you are fighting against forms of content designed to attract more attention, while they transport much less content.

While “classic form articles”, long reads, etc. should remain, we think that experimenting with alternative forms for that “serious” content, which gives way and serves as an entry point to the classic articles is a path to be explored.

The question is: we are in the business of sharing, spreading and discussing ideas; which alternative forms can we experiment with to go further with that mission?

Should we create a repository of values/ideas that compiles the issues that are developed in long articles, creating and index of these ideas that links to-from the articles, enabling people to adscribe to them? When a reader finishes up reading an article, she would have listed the values/ideas in it, she could explore an idea, see all the articles that talk about it, could adscribe to it, expand the content, create a derived concept/idea… A community layer quickly emerges, with matches with some other concepts treated later in this document.

The fact that a big part of our audience has an activist profile is a key fact. Which tools should we give them to “work” with our content, to make them allies in its diffusion, to provide them with tools to amplify that discussion? Can we transform some our readers into “diffusion agents”?


### Engagement levers
What engagement levers can we work with to achieve our objectives? Given clients nature, the topics discussed, and the idea of using readers as allies, we think engagement levers should be defined after some research and discovery work. Some of them can take the form of specific tools.

Aside from specific publishing tools, what other tools can we provide to help our readers to work with our content? A tool to easily compile, share and visualize data? A discussion tool that makes it easy to compile arguments, enable other readers to weigh in and extract conclusions? A tool to make lists of facts/ideas that automatically creates a video to publish in Facebook, as an easy-entry to a longform article?


### Fundraising and monetisation
We think a key issue around fundraising, specially when talking about individual donations, is to create specific campaigns that define boundaries around the theme and moment of the fundraising. The more specific you are in terms of the time and the issue, the better, as that enables you to communicate a sense of urgency and people see exactly what the money is going to be used for.

We see lots of opportunities around periodic donations and how we can re-design from the ground up the experience of donating. Don’t just ask me for money. Create some kind of story and incentive; people will be happy to help, but you’ll get much more conversion if you press some levers.

Maybe a concept of memberships could be developed, so we get people to feel a sense of belonging to a community while we get them to contribute economically? This would impact in engagement, subscribers and donations.


### Identity and community
Related with the concept of memberships are the ones of identity and community that might be further developed. Right now I see an invitation to register in the website - but what that does mean? What it is in for me? A visitor may imagine that if she registers she will get updates… but is that the strongest claim we can communicate? Maybe we can invite her to form part of a community of activists working for the causes she care for? Maybe we can invite her to get to know people that can help her? To follow specifically the topics she is interested in? To provide access to a members-only Q&A site? To contribute to our idea repository?


### Content distribution
In a more practical layer, we should look at what may be called the “new era of content syndication”. People are reading content inside native platforms like Facebook, Linkedin, Medium… so we should take our content over there in an automated fashion. Also taking into account new technical formats like Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles.


These are just some quick notes after an initial exploration, and should be taken as that. Further refinement of ideas and proposals is needed.
